# Content Packeter Prompt

- Source: `src/llm/prompts/content-packeter-prompt.ts`
- Orchestration: `src/llm/content-packeter-generation.ts`
- Output schema: `src/llm/schemas/content-packeter-schema.ts`
- Models: `src/models/content-packet.ts`

## Pipeline Position

Stage 3 in the content generation pipeline. Selects and expands the 12-16 strongest sparks into load-bearing content packets with explicit setup context plus the lean downstream packet fields.

**Pipeline**: Taste Distiller → Sparkstormer → **Content Packeter** → Content Evaluator

## System Message Template

```text
You are a content expansion architect for interactive fiction. Select the strongest sparks and expand them into load-bearing content packets — fully structured seeds with social engines, choice pressure, escalation paths, and wildness invariants.

Every packet must feel specific, human, and charged.

## User Message Template

```text
Select and expand the 12-16 strongest sparks into content packets with explicit setup context.

TASTE PROFILE:
{{tasteProfile JSON}}

SPARKS:
{{sparks array from sparkstormer}}

{{optional STORY KERNEL block}}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return JSON: { "packets": ContentPacketerPacket[] }
- 12-16 packets total
- Every packet must have ALL required fields
- Each packet must include `premiseSummary`, `situationFrame`, and `worldState`
- `viewpointPressure` is optional
- Honour taste profile's collision patterns, tone blend, scene appetites
- Respect antiPatterns and surfaceDoNotRepeat
```

## Context Table

| Field | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| tasteProfile | Taste Distiller output | Yes |
| sparks | Sparkstormer output | Yes |
| kernel | StoryKernel | No |

## Downstream Usage

Content packets are the primary semantic units consumed by concept stages:

- **Concept Seeder**: Each seed assigns a `primaryContentId` from packets
- **Concept Architect**: Operationalizes `coreAnomaly` in settingAxioms, derives keyInstitutions from `socialEngine`
- **Concept Engineer**: Uses `escalationPath` and `socialEngine` for pressureSource/ironicTwist
- **Concept Specificity**: Uses `wildnessInvariant` + `dullCollapse` for invariant-removal test
- **Concept Stress Tester**: Uses `wildnessInvariant` + `dullCollapse` for erosion check

## Notes

- `wildnessInvariant` is the most critical field — it carries the core strangeness that must survive all downstream stages
- `dullCollapse` describes the failure mode — what the packet becomes if its uniqueness is stripped away
- `interactionVerbs` (4-6) provide concrete player action vocabulary
- `premiseSummary`, `situationFrame`, and `worldState` are generation-time context inputs for the saved asset candidate; they are not part of the lean downstream `ContentPacket` projection used by concept stages
- `sourceSparkIds` traces lineage back to sparkstormer output and should be treated as transient generation lineage rather than a persisted display alias
- Packets may fuse multiple sparks (multiple sourceSparkIds)
