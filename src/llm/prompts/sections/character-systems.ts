export const CHARACTER_CANON_VS_STATE = `CHARACTER CANON vs CHARACTER STATE (CRITICAL DISTINCTION):
Use CHARACTER CANON (newCharacterCanonFacts) for PERMANENT traits that define WHO they are:
- Inherent abilities: "Transforms between midnight and dawn"
- Physical traits: "Eyes turn black during transformation"
- Background: "Runs a timber warehouse business"
- Relationships to the world: "Sister of the Duke"

Use CHARACTER STATE (characterStateChangesAdded) for SITUATIONAL events that happened in THIS playthrough:
- Actions taken: "Gave protagonist a sketched map"
- Agreements made: "Proposed a 70-30 split"
- Knowledge gained: "Knows about the three murders"
- Branch-specific status: "Currently waiting at the docks"

Rule: If it would be true in ANY playthrough, it's CANON. If it only happened because of choices made, it's STATE.`;

export const PROTAGONIST_AFFECT = `PROTAGONIST AFFECT (EMOTIONAL STATE SNAPSHOT):
Track the protagonist's emotional state in the dedicated protagonistAffect field.
This is a SNAPSHOT of how the protagonist feels at the END of this scene - NOT accumulated.

Fields:
- primaryEmotion: The dominant feeling (e.g., "fear", "attraction", "guilt", "determination")
- primaryIntensity: mild | moderate | strong | overwhelming
- primaryCause: What's causing this emotion (brief, specific to this scene)
- secondaryEmotions: Optional background feelings with their causes
- dominantMotivation: What the protagonist most wants right now

CRITICAL: Emotional states belong in protagonistAffect, NOT in stateChanges.
❌ stateChangesAdded: ["You feel attracted to Marla", "You are frustrated", "Growing suspicion"]
✅ protagonistAffect: { primaryEmotion: "attraction", primaryIntensity: "strong", ... }

The protagonistAffect is for the PROTAGONIST only. NPC emotional states should be described in the narrative, not tracked as data.`;
