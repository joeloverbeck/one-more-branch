export const ACTIVE_STATE_TRACKING = `=== ACTIVE STATE TRACKING ===

Track the story's current state using structured fields. These represent what is TRUE RIGHT NOW, not a history of what happened.

LOCATION:
- Set "currentLocation" to where the protagonist is at the END of this scene
- If location doesn't change, set to the same value as before
- Be specific: "cramped maintenance tunnel" not just "tunnel"

THREATS (dangers that exist NOW):
- Add new threats using format: "THREAT_IDENTIFIER: Description"
- The IDENTIFIER should be short and unique (e.g., THREAT_FIRE, THREAT_GUARDS, THREAT_CREATURE)
- To remove a resolved threat, put ONLY the prefix in "threatsRemoved" (e.g., "THREAT_FIRE")
- Only include threats that are CURRENTLY present, not past dangers

CONSTRAINTS (limitations affecting protagonist NOW):
- Add using format: "CONSTRAINT_IDENTIFIER: Description"
- Examples: CONSTRAINT_INJURED_LEG, CONSTRAINT_TIME_LIMIT, CONSTRAINT_NO_LIGHT
- Remove when constraint is no longer active

THREADS (unresolved narrative hooks):
- Add using format: "THREAD_IDENTIFIER: Description"
- These are mysteries, unanswered questions, or plot hooks
- Examples: THREAD_LETTER_CONTENTS, THREAD_STRANGER_IDENTITY
- Resolve when the mystery is answered or hook is resolved

Rules:
1. For removals, use ONLY the prefix (e.g., "THREAT_FIRE"), not the full entry
2. Each prefix should be unique within its category
3. Don't duplicate entries - update by removing old and adding new
4. Empty arrays mean "no changes" for that category

Example output for active state:

{
  "currentLocation": "abandoned subway platform",
  "threatsAdded": [
    "THREAT_RATS: Large rats moving in the shadows",
    "THREAT_UNSTABLE_FLOOR: Floor tiles are cracking"
  ],
  "threatsRemoved": ["THREAT_GUARD"],
  "constraintsAdded": [
    "CONSTRAINT_FLASHLIGHT_DIM: Flashlight battery is failing"
  ],
  "constraintsRemoved": [],
  "threadsAdded": [
    "THREAD_GRAFFITI: Strange symbols on the wall"
  ],
  "threadsResolved": ["THREAT_LOCKED_DOOR"]
}`;

export const INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT = `INVENTORY MANAGEMENT:
- Use inventoryAdded for items the protagonist GAINS (be specific: "Rusty iron key", "50 gold coins", not just "key" or "money").
- Use inventoryRemoved for items LOST, USED UP, BROKEN, or DISCARDED (use EXACT text from existing inventory).
- Reference inventory items naturally in the narrative when relevant.
- Items in inventory can enable or unlock certain choices.
- Duplicates are allowed (e.g., multiple "Health Potion" entries).`;

export const HEALTH_MANAGEMENT = `HEALTH MANAGEMENT:
- Use healthAdded for PHYSICAL conditions the protagonist ACQUIRES (wounds, poison, injuries, illness, exhaustion).
- Use healthRemoved for conditions that are HEALED or RESOLVED (use EXACT text from existing health entries).
- Do NOT add a condition that already exists. If a condition worsens, remove the old entry and add the updated one.
- Reference health conditions naturally in the narrative when relevant.
- Physical conditions should affect available choices when appropriate (e.g., injured leg limits running).
- Health is for PHYSICAL conditions only (emotions belong in protagonistAffect).
- Examples of health conditions: "Your head throbs painfully", "Poison spreads through your arm", "You feel exhausted", "A deep gash mars your shoulder".`;

export const FIELD_SEPARATION = `FIELD SEPARATION:
- INVENTORY (inventoryAdded/inventoryRemoved): Physical objects the protagonist possesses, gains, or loses
- HEALTH (healthAdded/healthRemoved): Physical wounds, injuries, poison, illness, exhaustion - NOT emotional states
- ACTIVE STATE (threatsAdded/threatsRemoved, constraintsAdded/constraintsRemoved, threadsAdded/threadsResolved): Current dangers, limitations, and narrative hooks using PREFIX_ID: Description format
- PROTAGONIST AFFECT (protagonistAffect): Protagonist's emotional state SNAPSHOT at end of scene - NOT accumulated
- WORLD FACTS (newCanonFacts): Permanent world-building facts - NOT items or character traits
- CHARACTER CANON (newCharacterCanonFacts): PERMANENT character traits, backgrounds, abilities - WHO they are
- CHARACTER STATE (characterStateChangesAdded/characterStateChangesRemoved): SITUATIONAL NPC events - WHAT happened in THIS branch`;
