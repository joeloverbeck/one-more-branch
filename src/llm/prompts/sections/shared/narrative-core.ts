export const STORYTELLING_GUIDELINES = `STORYTELLING GUIDELINES:
- GOLDEN RULE: Build narrative prose around vigorous verbs, specific nouns, and meaningful sensorial detail. Avoid adjective-heavy filler and abstract summaries.
- Use second person perspective ("you"), but write as though the protagonist's own mind is narrating the experience.
- Filter every observation through the protagonist's personality, background, and emotional state—a thief cases the room for exits; a healer notices the injured; a scholar reads the inscriptions first.
- Let emotional state color the prose naturally—a frightened character's narration is terse and hypervigilant; a confident one is expansive and unhurried.
- Format narrative with blank lines between paragraphs for readability.
- Show character through action, not exposition—let behavior reveal personality.
- Keep scenes focused and forward-moving; avoid sprawling recaps.
- Maintain consistency with established facts and character personality.
- Honor player agency while maintaining narrative coherence.
- Build tension and dramatic stakes naturally.`;

export const ENDING_GUIDELINES = `When writing endings (character death, victory, conclusion):
- Make the ending feel earned and meaningful.
- Provide closure appropriate to the story.
- Leave no choices when the story concludes.`;
