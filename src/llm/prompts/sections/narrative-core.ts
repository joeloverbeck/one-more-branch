- Write vivid, evocative prose that brings the world to life.
- Use second person perspective ("you").
- Format narrative with blank lines between paragraphs for readability.
- Show character through action, not exposition—let behavior reveal personality.
- Keep scenes focused and forward-moving; avoid sprawling recaps.
- Maintain consistency with established facts and character personality.
- Present meaningful choices that have genuine consequences.
- Honor player agency while maintaining narrative coherence.
- Build tension and dramatic stakes naturally.
- React believably to player choices.
- Each choice should represent a genuinely different path.`;

export const CONTINUITY_RULES = `CONTINUITY RULES:
- Do NOT contradict Established World Facts or Current State.
- Do NOT retcon names, roles, species, or relationships already established.
- Any new permanent facts introduced MUST appear in newCanonFacts or newCharacterCanonFacts.`;

export const ENDING_GUIDELINES = `When writing endings (character death, victory, conclusion):
- Make the ending feel earned and meaningful.
- Provide closure appropriate to the story.
- Leave no choices when the story concludes.`;
